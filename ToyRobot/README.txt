Toy Robot Simulator

Description

The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, 
of dimensions 5 units x 5 units.

There are no other obstructions on the table surface.

The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be 
prevented from falling to destruction. Any movement that would result in the 
robot falling from the table must be prevented, however further valid movement 
commands will still be allowed.

The applications reads in a .txt file with commands in the following form:

PLACE X,Y,F
MOVE
LEFT
RIGHT
REPORT

PLACE will put the toy robot on the table in position X,Y and facing 
NORTH, SOUTH, EAST or WEST.

The origin (0,0) can be considered to be the SOUTH WEST most corner.

The first valid command to the robot is a PLACE command, after that, 
any sequence of commands may be issued, in any order, including another PLACE command. 
The application should discard all commands in the sequence until a valid PLACE 
command has been executed

MOVE will move the toy robot one unit forward in the direction it is currently facing.

LEFT and RIGHT will rotate the robot 90 degrees in the specified direction without 
changing the position of the robot.

REPORT will announce the X,Y and F of the robot. This can be in any form, but standard 
output is sufficient.

A robot that is not on the table will ignore the MOVE, LEFT, RIGHT and 
REPORT commands.

Example Input and Output:

Example a
